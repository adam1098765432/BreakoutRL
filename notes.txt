Terms
- Policy: The probability of taking an action given a state
- Value: The predicted winner or final score
- Immediate Reward: The reward for taking an action
- Trajectories: A sequence of states and actions

MuZero
- Learns a latent model of the environment
- Uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- Requires past sequences of observations (frames/states) and actions to be stored
- Actions are encoded as constant bias planes (additional channels to the latent representation)
- MCTS predicts the next state using the previous state and action
  - Only masks valid actions at the root of the search tree
- MCTS can proceed past a terminal node, and is expected to return the same terminal state

Functions
- h: Representation function (predicts latent representation for a given state)
- g: Dynamics function (predicts next state and immediate reward given previous state and action)
  - r^k: Reward network (predicts immediate reward for a given state and action)
  - s^k: State network (predicts next state for a given state and action)
- f: Prediction function
  - p^k: Policy network (predicts the immediate action probabilities for a given state)
  - v^k: Value network (predicts the final reward for a given state)

Loss
- Loss = MSE(reward) + MSE(value) + CELoss(policy) + L2_Regularization
- L2_Regularization (weight decay) = theta_f + theta_h + theta_g

Replay Buffer
- Stores trajectories: K * (prev_state, next_state, action, reward, is_done)

Targets
- Value target: the discounted cumulative rewards over multiple timesteps
- Policy target: the final action probabilities from the MCTS search tree
  (normalized visit counts from MCTS at the root)
- Reward target: the observed immediate reward at each step

Categorical reward and value
- Rewards and values are encoded as probability distributions for scores -300 to 300
- Targets are mapped to this distribution (phi)

TODO:
- Fix Node and MCTS class to reflect the pseudocode << Emmett
- Finish the replay buffer class << Justin
- Add self play (data generation)
- Complete training loop (how are the gradients stored?)
- Sample a position from the replay buffer using get_sampling_priority
- Vectorize targets in get_targets to match output of the network.
